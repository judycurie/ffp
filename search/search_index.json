design, analysis, optimization and fabrication of asymptotic gridshells. Tutors: Judy Curie, Szymon Loj Dates: 16-17th March 2024 Location: \u0141okietka 12c, Wroc\u0142aw (Fab Institute) Prerequisite Skills: basic Grasshopper skills Prerequisite: personal laptop with the installed Rhino software (evaluation versions allowed) Software: Rhino, Grasshopper, Karamba, custom-made components & plug-ins In this workshop, participants will gain an understanding of the concept of structural art and explore how structures can embody elegance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness simultaneously. The focus will be on timber elastic gridshells, with a specific emphasis on asymptotic gridshells, which represent promising systems in this field. Asymptotic gridshells ingeniously generate highly structurally efficient systems by employing initially flat timber stripes (laths) that are actively bent: video . The stringent geometric and material constraints contribute to their affordability, making them one of the most economical choices in the realm of structural design. Achieving structural efficiency with minimal materials and construction costs is made possible through restricted geometry modeling, taking material considerations into account. This workshop is tailored for individuals with backgrounds in architecture or structural engineering, both students and professionals alike. Participants will learn to utilize parametric tools for designing shapes capable of serving as structural shells. The workshop will also cover the basics of structural analysis for such forms, enabling attendees to transform their designs into impressive, structurally sound gridshell structures. During the workshop, we will delve into practical aspects of design preparation for digital fabrication. Participants will gain hands-on experience in testing materials and utilizing laser cutting techniques. Ultimately, each participant will have the opportunity to construct their own prototypes, bringing the theoretical concepts learned in the workshop to life through tangible and personalized projects.

Simulation & Reality movies availeble on Youtube - simulation - model folding Design & Fabrication The beauty of asymptotic gridhshell lies in the ease of fabrication. The 3D laths unroll to flat starlight strips which can be manufactured by laser, milling or even by hand. To produce below fabrication layout, I prepared a custom Python script for unrolling and labeling of the elements and joints. The code produces layout for the bottom layer of the asymptotics. The script accounts for the laser beam size (kerf), material thickness, width of the material and tolerances. The joint connection shape can be rectangular or defined by custom draw curve. Key take aways: the material thickness was around 0.88mm, and the slot had 1mm width, not taking into account kerf, allowing on the rotation around 75deg -> this caused difficulty to assemble it in the flat state, but also triggered the self-assembly effect larger tolerances on joints cause that elements that has few connections required fastening to not fall off from the flat model state Next steps: accounting for kerf, and the mobility of 60 deg will help in the flat assembly, but decrease the self assembly \"willingness\" self-interlocking joint would allow to keep the larger tolerances and prevent from falling of elements in the flat state 03 - Structural Analysis: Single vs Double Layer Design Workflow Realizing the complexity of the asymptotic gridshell design enabling erection from a flat grid. source: Schling, E., & Schikore, J.

Key take aways: the angle between joints change more further from the center -> joints closer to legs(supports) need more rotational freedom the joints should allow movement 75-90 deg (more is not necessary e.g. most right example) 05 - Structurally Feasible 1:1 model For the kinetic-actuated assembly with simple joints (cuts in the laths), I have to keep the structure of the asymptotic gridshell from a single layer of asymptotic laths. However, as the structural analysis shows above, the structure is too weak with the single layer plywood laths 6.5mm thick. Increasing thickness is not possible due to the bending (thicker material cannot bend that easily and can easily break- causing structural failure). The project assumption is to use kinetic movement for assembly (and maybe disassembly), preferably only once in the Life Cycle of the structure - to assemble it on the site. The assembly device should work as assembler of the structure and not as a kinetic actuator for the kinetic sculpture. Therefore to keep the single layer of the asymptotic grid (which can be easily assembled from flat), I added a developable plates, which will be mounted between laths after assembly to check the structural performance. Key take aways: assuming the 1:1 gridshell structure with filling developable plates the structural performance is satisfactory Next steps: calculation of the material thickness for 1:5 stiffness scaled model -> testing the kinetic joints with tolerances - > preparation of the fabrication files 06 - Stiffness-scaled models Calculating the thickness of plywood for stiffness-scaled model 1:5.

Key take aways: considering stiffness-scaling, already for 1:5 scale, I need a very thin plywood of 0.8mm-1mm, therefore the 1:5 scale was considered as suitable for prototype Defining structurally sound shell thickness The shell structural analysis was conducted with Karamba3d. assuming the subsurface is a shell of constant thickness, uniformly supported at all edges (Fig.2), made with birch plywood with the following properties: Elasticity Modulus (E) = 8750MPa, Bending Strength, Density (\ud835\udee0) = 450kg/m3, Compressive Strength (fco) = 38MPa.

Example: Material thickness = 1mm, we would like to allow for 60 degree rotational freedom, the beam size/kerf of the laser used 0.05mm: slot size (NOT accounting for kerf) = 1mm * 1.36 = 1.36mm slot size (accounting for kerf) = 1mm * 1.36 - 0.05 = 1.31mm Model 57 Plywood 0.6mm (real 0.69mm) kerf with the Speed 100 Power 100 on the small slot (1mm)- 0.3mm both sides / 0.15mm one side if t = 0.69mm - 75 = 1.22*0.69 = 0.8418 if the slot in the laser cut will have 0.6mm, in reality it will result in the slot 0.9mm and will allow for 75 rotation movement Model 39 Plywood 1.0mm (real 1.09mm) kerf with the Speed 100 Power 100 on the small slot (1mm)- 0.3mm both sides / 0.15mm one side if t = 1.09mm - 75 = 1.22*1.09 = 1.3298 if the slot in the laser cut will have 1.0mm, in reality it will result in the slot 1.3mm and will allow for 75 rotation movement 09 - Structural Analysis of the models In order to verify if the seleced asymptotic and built asymptoric gridshell protoypes are structurally sound and exhinbit simil structural perfomance both computational structural analysi and physical tests were performed.

OPTISHELL-GOLDFISH optimizer Within the OPTIshell project a multi-objective version of the recent Constraint Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization without Velocity (CMPSOWV) is developed. With the focus on wider adoption of optimization aimed at solving multi-objective constrained engineering design problems in practice, the proposed method is implemented in the popular Grasshopper framework as a new optimization plug-in \u201cGoldfish\u201d. As CMPSOWV, the MOCMPSOWV algorithm is supposed to obtain highly diversified optimization results thanks to incorporating the multi-swarm approach and the enlarged search scope for the best solution in the multiple locations of the hyperspace. The introduced MOCMPSOWV algorithm in the Goldfish framework has proven its superiority over algorithms such as: MOPSO, NSGA-II, SPEA, SPEA2, MOGA, MOEA/D in the quality of solution criteria and computing time in the engineering design problems such as: Welded beam case, Pressure Vessel case and multi-objective test functions.

However, ADO's impact remains rather restricted due to the lack of optimisers dedicated to multi-objective constrained optimisation problems (CMOPs) and the absence of industry-validated evidence on ADO benefits. The EU-funded OPTIshell project will fit ADO with an innovative optimisation algorithm based on swarm intelligence (SI) apposite for CMOPs. The results will provide decisive information on the applicability of SI methods for CMOPs in the design domain and will demonstrate ADO benefits through the optimisation and construction of the solar timber gridshell prototype powered by flexible perovskites modules. link OPTISHELL-GENERAL Information This project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No 101033646 Grant :Horizon 2020, MSCA IF, OPTIshell (EU funding: 101033646) Title :A framework for the multi-objective optimization of timber gridshells under structural and energy-based criteria. Acronim : OPTIshell Host Institution : Saule Technologies, PL Realization Time 01.03.2022 - 29.02.2024 Objective : The OVERALL OBJECTIVE of OPTIshell was to introduce into ADO the optimization algorithm based on Swarm Intelligence dedicated for constrained, multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) and demonstrate the ADO benefits through the optimization and construction of solar timber gridshell CarPort4.0. To reach this overall objective, the project focused on 4 specific objectives: Objective 1 : Implementation of the constrained multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (CMOPSO) algorithm in a design tool and benchmarking. Objective 2 : Creating a parametric model of CarPort4.0 and formulation of the solar energy collection and mass minimization as a CMOP. 3) Objective 3: Evaluation of the importance of internal tuning on the performance of the CMOPSO algorithm. 4) Objective 4: Physical construction of the randomly selected valid solution (CarPort4.0) and the optimal solution (CarPort4.0+) to prove the benefits of ADO.

Modular arrangements - isometry. 02- Prototyping Fabrication I prepared the first model from the thin plywood to test the unrolling script. Simulation & Reality movies availeble on Youtube - simulation - model folding Design & Fabrication The beauty of asymptotic gridhshell lies in the ease of fabrication. The 3D laths unroll to flat starlight strips which can be manufactured by laser, milling or even by hand. To produce below fabrication layout, I prepared a custom Python script for unrolling and labeling of the elements and joints. The code produces layout for the bottom layer of the asymptotics. The script accounts for the laser beam size (kerf), material thickness, width of the material and tolerances. The joint connection shape can be rectangular or defined by custom draw curve. Key take aways: the material thickness was around 0.88mm, and the slot had 1mm width, not taking into account kerf, allowing on the rotation around 75deg -> this caused difficulty to assemble it in the flat state, but also triggered the self-assembly effect larger tolerances on joints cause that elements that has few connections required fastening to not fall off from the flat model state Next steps: accounting for kerf, and the mobility of 60 deg will help in the flat assembly, but decrease the self assembly \"willingness\" self-interlocking joint would allow to keep the larger tolerances and prevent from falling of elements in the flat state 03 - Structural Analysis: Single vs Double Layer Design Workflow Realizing the complexity of the asymptotic gridshell design enabling erection from a flat grid. source: Schling, E., & Schikore, J.

Key take aways: the angle between joints change more further from the center -> joints closer to legs(supports) need more rotational freedom the joints should allow movement 75-90 deg (more is not necessary e.g. most right example) 05 - Structurally Feasible 1:1 model For the kinetic-actuated assembly with simple joints (cuts in the laths), I have to keep the structure of the asymptotic gridshell from a single layer of asymptotic laths. However, as the structural analysis shows above, the structure is too weak with the single layer plywood laths 6.5mm thick. Increasing thickness is not possible due to the bending (thicker material cannot bend that easily and can easily break- causing structural failure). The project assumption is to use kinetic movement for assembly (and maybe disassembly), preferably only once in the Life Cycle of the structure - to assemble it on the site. The assembly device should work as assembler of the structure and not as a kinetic actuator for the kinetic sculpture. Therefore to keep the single layer of the asymptotic grid (which can be easily assembled from flat), I added a developable plates, which will be mounted between laths after assembly to check the structural performance. Key take aways: assuming the 1:1 gridshell structure with filling developable plates the structural performance is satisfactory Next steps: calculation of the material thickness for 1:5 stiffness scaled model -> testing the kinetic joints with tolerances - > preparation of the fabrication files 06 - Stiffness-scaled models Calculating the thickness of plywood for stiffness-scaled model 1:5.

OPTISHELL-GOLDFISH optimizer Within the OPTIshell project a multi-objective version of the recent Constraint Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization without Velocity (CMPSOWV) is developed. With the focus on wider adoption of optimization aimed at solving multi-objective constrained engineering design problems in practice, the proposed method is implemented in the popular Grasshopper framework as a new optimization plug-in \u201cGoldfish\u201d. As CMPSOWV, the MOCMPSOWV algorithm is supposed to obtain highly diversified optimization results thanks to incorporating the multi-swarm approach and the enlarged search scope for the best solution in the multiple locations of the hyperspace. The introduced MOCMPSOWV algorithm in the Goldfish framework has proven its superiority over algorithms such as: MOPSO, NSGA-II, SPEA, SPEA2, MOGA, MOEA/D in the quality of solution criteria and computing time in the engineering design problems such as: Welded beam case, Pressure Vessel case and multi-objective test functions.

Increasing thickness is not possible due to the bending (thicker material cannot bend that easily and can easily break- causing structural failure). The project assumption is to use kinetic movement for assembly (and maybe disassembly), preferably only once in the Life Cycle of the structure - to assemble it on the site. The assembly device should work as assembler of the structure and not as a kinetic actuator for the kinetic sculpture. Therefore to keep the single layer of the asymptotic grid (which can be easily assembled from flat), I added a developable plates, which will be mounted between laths after assembly to check the structural performance.

Contact: gba@mit.edu Link to website Prof. Janusz R\u0119bielak Polish architect and engineer, professor of technical sciences. He has been working at the Cracow University of Technology (TU Cracow) since 2008. He was a head of Chair of Structures and Construction Engineering (A-42) and moreover he was head of Postgraduate Study BIM \u201cBuilding Information Modeling \u2013 digital technologies in architecture and construction\u201d at the TU Cracow. His research work evolves around numerical methods for shaping spatial structures as well as proposals for their applications for high span roof systems, high-rise buildings and the innovative methods of their safe foundation on soils with poor load capacity, especially on mining damage sectors and in earthquake areas . His original system of combine foundation is a breakthrough technical solution in this area of engineering activities. He also developed a two-stage method of calculation of statically indeterminate trusses and a method of secondary grid deformation, which enables to design the most regular triangular grids for geodesic domes; he is also involved in working out the innovative concepts of the structural systems for the vertical take-off and landing airplanes and for the short take-off and landing airplanes, as well as the innovative concepts of the technical solutions for the retractable roof structures. So far he published over 230 scientific papers. Prof. R\u0119bielak has been a Chairman of the Committee on Architecture and Urban Planning of the of Wroclaw Branch of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) since 2006 and he was member of some national and international scientific societies as well as a member of scientific boards or editorial committees of national and international scientific journals; at present, among others, a member of the Editorial Board of The International Journal of Computational Methods (IJCM). More at: http://januszrebielak.pl and wikipedia . ** Prof. Jacek Ko\u015bciuk** Prof. Ko\u015bciuk is an innovator in the application of 3D scanning for creating digital documentation of historical and archeological objects. 3D laser scanning, modeling and simulations not only enhance the heritage documentation with the 3D digital twins, but it also can aid dating the objects by analysis of brics dimensions or helped to discover the ancient Incaic measuring units. The 3D documentation made with sub-millimeter precision is of key importance for monitoring atmospheric and climatic factors causing erosion processes and implementing proper conservation programs. Over 40 years of experience in building archaeology and architectural monument preservation in Poland and worldwide, including +15 sites from the UNESCO World Heritage List e.g. Temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari (Egypt), El Fuerte de Samaipata (Bolivia), Corikancha temple in Cusco and Machu Picchu (Peru). In 2007 he founded the the Laboratory of 3D Scanning and Modeling within Wroclaw University of Technology and Science (TU Wroclaw), which he was supervising as a head-director. Prof. Ko\u015bciuk was the first professor in Poland who supervised doctoral thesis into digital design, 3D scanning, simulation and optimization. Thanks to him the Laboratory of Digital Fabrication LabDigiFab was funded within TU Wroclaw. This student organization was a unique opportunity at that time to get skills and knowledge about digital design and fabrication. The former students of LabDigiFab, continued their education graduating from among others MIT, UCL Bartlett or ICD Stuttgart. During its activity LabDigiFab organized in 2015 first in Poland International Conference of Parametric Design Shapes of Logic link , followed in 2017 by its second edition link . In 2020 Prof. Kosciuk was awarded the highest scientific nomination by the Polish President. By younger generations he is often referred to as a father (or a god father) of bringing new technologies into architectural education in Poland.

He has been working at the Cracow University of Technology (TU Cracow) since 2008. He was a head of Chair of Structures and Construction Engineering (A-42) and moreover he was head of Postgraduate Study BIM \u201cBuilding Information Modeling \u2013 digital technologies in architecture and construction\u201d at the TU Cracow. His research work evolves around numerical methods for shaping spatial structures as well as proposals for their applications for high span roof systems, high-rise buildings and the innovative methods of their safe foundation on soils with poor load capacity, especially on mining damage sectors and in earthquake areas . His original system of combine foundation is a breakthrough technical solution in this area of engineering activities. He also developed a two-stage method of calculation of statically indeterminate trusses and a method of secondary grid deformation, which enables to design the most regular triangular grids for geodesic domes; he is also involved in working out the innovative concepts of the structural systems for the vertical take-off and landing airplanes and for the short take-off and landing airplanes, as well as the innovative concepts of the technical solutions for the retractable roof structures. So far he published over 230 scientific papers. Prof. R\u0119bielak has been a Chairman of the Committee on Architecture and Urban Planning of the of Wroclaw Branch of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) since 2006 and he was member of some national and international scientific societies as well as a member of scientific boards or editorial committees of national and international scientific journals; at present, among others, a member of the Editorial Board of The International Journal of Computational Methods (IJCM).

The 3D documentation made with sub-millimeter precision is of key importance for monitoring atmospheric and climatic factors causing erosion processes and implementing proper conservation programs. Over 40 years of experience in building archaeology and architectural monument preservation in Poland and worldwide, including +15 sites from the UNESCO World Heritage List e.g. Temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari (Egypt), El Fuerte de Samaipata (Bolivia), Corikancha temple in Cusco and Machu Picchu (Peru). In 2007 he founded the the Laboratory of 3D Scanning and Modeling within Wroclaw University of Technology and Science (TU Wroclaw), which he was supervising as a head-director. Prof. Ko\u015bciuk was the first professor in Poland who supervised doctoral thesis into digital design, 3D scanning, simulation and optimization. Thanks to him the Laboratory of Digital Fabrication LabDigiFab was funded within TU Wroclaw. This student organization was a unique opportunity at that time to get skills and knowledge about digital design and fabrication. The former students of LabDigiFab, continued their education graduating from among others MIT, UCL Bartlett or ICD Stuttgart. During its activity LabDigiFab organized in 2015 first in Poland International Conference of Parametric Design Shapes of Logic link , followed in 2017 by its second edition link . In 2020 Prof. Kosciuk was awarded the highest scientific nomination by the Polish President. By younger generations he is often referred to as a father (or a god father) of bringing new technologies into architectural education in Poland.
