# Fab Lab Wroclaw

Currently we are working on establishing a Fab Lab facility in Wroc≈Çaw!
We are looking for the proper space of around 400-500m2 with preferably 3.5-4m height. Our dream is to set it up in a post-industrial space well connected with the train hubs.
Below drawings prepared based on the [how to start a fab lab](https://fabfoundation.org/getting-started/#fab-lab-questions).
