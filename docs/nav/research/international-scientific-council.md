### ** Prof. Jacek Kościuk**

Prof. Kościuk is an innovator in the application of 3D scanning for creating digital documentation of historical and archeological objects. 3D laser scanning, modeling and simulations not only enhance the heritage documentation with the 3D digital twins, but it also can aid dating the objects by analysis of brics dimensions or helped to discover the ancient Incaic measuring units. The 3D documentation made with sub-millimeter precision is of key importance for monitoring atmospheric and climatic factors causing erosion processes and implementing proper conservation programs. Over 40 years of experience in building archaeology and architectural monument preservation in Poland and worldwide, including +15 sites from the UNESCO World Heritage List e.g.  Temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari (Egypt), El Fuerte de Samaipata (Bolivia), Corikancha temple in Cusco and  Machu Picchu (Peru). In 2018 his work on the 3D scanning of El Fuerte de Samaipata (Bolivia) was announced to be in the top 10 Polish archaeologist achievements.

In 2004 he founded the Institute of History of Architecture, Arts and Technology within Wroclaw University of Technology and Science (TU Wroclaw), which he was supervising as a director. Since 2007 he was also a head of the Laboratory of 3D Scanning and Modeling. Prof. Kościuk was the first professor in Poland who supervised doctoral thesis into digital design, 3D scanning, simulation and optimization. Thanks to him the Laboratory of Digital Fabrication [LabDigiFab](https://labdigifab.wordpress.com/) was funded within TU Wroclaw. This student organization was a unique opportunity at that time to get skills and knowledge about digital design and fabrication. The former students of LabDigiFab, continued their education graduating from among others MIT, UCL Bartlett or ICD Stuttgart.  During its activity LabDigiFab organized in 2015 first in Poland International Conference of Parametric Design *Shapes of Logic* [link](https://shapesoflogic.wordpress.com/), followed in 2017 by its second edition [link](https://es-la.facebook.com/shapesoflogic/). 

In 2020 Prof. Kosciuk was awarded the highest scientific nomination by the Polish President. By younger generations he is often referred to as a father (or a god father) of bringing new technologies into architectural education in Poland.
