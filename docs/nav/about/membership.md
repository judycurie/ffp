By joining FFP, you become an integral part of a vibrant community where collaboration thrives, and members actively contribute to the advancement of knowledge and innovation in the field. Welcome aboard, and let's shape the future of computational design and digital fabrication together!

In the collaborative ecosystem of design and fabrication, designers can connect with digital fabricators and local material providers to bring their projects to fruition. Machine owners, on the other hand, have the opportunity to identify designers and engage in production without the need for designing themselves. Fabricators play a crucial role by communicating their challenges to academia, opening avenues for research collaboration to address specific issues.

This dynamic interaction extends to scientists who receive real-world problems from fabricators, providing tangible challenges for their research projects. Additionally, companies within the industry can proactively suggest current or anticipated needs for new skills, helping to create courses  fostering a proactive approach to skill acquisition to remain competitive in the business landscape.  This interconnected network serves as a catalyst for innovation, problem-solving, and the continuous evolution of skills in the design and fabrication domain.

Stay conncected, stay informed, receive new opportunities, find collaborators, enjoy FFP resouces (books, codes, settings, designs), share problems, share ideas, share solutions, grow with us!
