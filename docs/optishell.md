In this workshop, participants will gain an understanding of the concept of structural art and explore how structures can embody elegance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness simultaneously. The focus will be on timber elastic gridshells, with a specific emphasis on asymptotic gridshells, which represent promising systems in this field.

Asymptotic gridshells ingeniously generate highly structurally efficient systems by employing initially flat timber stripes (laths) that are actively bent: [video](https://youtu.be/Y_U2DWwXKLk?si=vwjtZRz61z4fhmoq). The stringent geometric and material constraints contribute to their affordability, making them one of the most economical choices in the realm of structural design. Achieving structural efficiency with minimal materials and construction costs is made possible through restricted geometry modeling, taking material considerations into account.

This workshop is tailored for individuals with backgrounds in architecture or structural engineering, both students and professionals alike. Participants will learn to utilize parametric tools for designing shapes capable of serving as structural shells. The workshop will also cover the basics of structural analysis for such forms, enabling attendees to transform their designs into impressive, structurally sound gridshell structures.

During the workshop, we will delve into practical aspects of design preparation for digital fabrication. Participants will gain hands-on experience in testing materials and utilizing laser cutting techniques. Ultimately, each participant will have the opportunity to construct their own prototypes, bringing the theoretical concepts learned in the workshop to life through tangible and personalized projects.
